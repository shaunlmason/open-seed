# progress.md — the Seed implementation frontier

The single resume point (docs/next-build-plan.md §4): one line per plan item,
`phase.item — card id — PR — state`. A fresh agent resumes from this file
alone: read it top to bottom, verify the PR states it claims against the
forge, then take the frontier line's next action. Keep it truthful in every
PR that touches `next/**`; never start new work while it misstates the
frontier.

## Roster and conventions

- Implementer actor: `seed-next-implementer` (work verbs). Operator queue
  verbs for `next:` cards run under the session principal per
  `decisions/0003-next-loop-delegation.md`.
- Cards carry the `next:` title prefix; branches `seed/<card>` (task) and
  `seed/<card>-plan` (plan); receipts generated with `--run --write` before
  review.
- Phase gate: a phase starts when its dependencies' exit criteria are
  **merged** (docs/next-build-plan.md §2).

## Ledger

- 0.1 module scaffold + CI wiring (`make check-next`) — os-116ca9ac — plan
  PR #71, task PR #72 — **done** (merged; card closed)
- 0.2 spec skeleton (`next/spec/protocol.md`, `next/spec/envelope.md`) —
  os-116ca9ac — task PR #72 — **done** (merged; encodings and upgrade-safe
  version semantics per #71/#75 review)
- 0.3 decision log (`next/docs/decisions.md`; plus this frontier file) —
  os-116ca9ac — task PR #72 — **done** (merged)
- 1.1 event model + JCS + Ed25519 — os-aa146827 — plan PR #73, task PR
  #76 — **done** (merged; strict wire parsing + lowercase-only hex per
  review; card closed)
- 1.2 chain/segments/HEAD — os-ead12024 — plan PR #74 (merged, amended),
  task PR #79 — **done** (merged; card closed)
- 1.3 genesis via `seed init` — os-d636299d — plan PR #75 (merged,
  amended), task PR #83 — **done** (merged; genesis-payload version
  bootstrap + position-stamped init refusal per review; card closed)
- 1.4 push-race append loop — os-62e2aa1d — plan PR #81 (merged,
  amended: monotonic head + rollback drill), task PR #86 — **done**
  (merged; vanished-ref regression refusal + typed remote-rejection per
  review; card closed)
- 1.5 halt semantics in the rule set — os-bce3fb98 — plan PR #78 (merged,
  amended: exit code 7, reason-carrying state), task PR #84 — **done**
  (merged; halted refusal ordering + empty lift payload per review; card
  closed)
- 1.6 payload classification lint + hostile corpus — os-d6f81ec6 — plan
  PR #77 (merged, amended: aggregate free-text budget, embedded rules),
  task PR #80 — **done** (merged; narrowed anchor exemption + RFC 6901
  pointers per review; card closed)
- 1.7 CLI `seed ledger verify/append/show` — os-89412090 — plan PR #82
  (merged, amended: envelope v0 preserved, exit 9), task PR #85 —
  **done** (merged; position-stamped verify refusals, read-only show,
  active-version append per review; card closed)

**Phase 1 exit (charter III.A): met.** The chain verifies from genesis in
one command (`seed ledger verify`, #85); corrupted fixtures (reordered,
rewritten, forged-sig, bad-prev, lying HEAD, lying genesis) are detected
with positioned reasons (#79/#83/#85); the hostile classification corpus
passes (#80); the race drill (two concurrent appenders, no lost updates,
a real retry observed) is green on main (#86). This exit record is card
os-beac85e1's task PR (an administrative card, not a Phase 2 item).

## Phase 2 — Admission (docs/next-build-plan.md Phase 2; deps: 1 ✓)

- 2.1 admission rule set library (`internal/admit`) — os-3898f232 —
  plan PR #88 (merged, amended: ledger `WithObserver` + shared upgrade
  schema in scope), task PR #90 — **done** (merged; card closed)
- 2.2 cooperative posture (client self-validation) — os-895bf828 —
  plan PR #91 (merged, amended: gitref verify-option pass-through +
  update-phase race marker), task PR #93 — **done** (merged; state-dir
  lock + position-stamped refusals per review; card closed)
- 2.3 enforced posture, `seed-admit` pre-receive hook — os-d3591e09 —
  plan PR #92 (merged), task PR #94 — **done** (merged; tree-shape gate
  + exclusion-based rule selection per review; card closed)
- 2.4 posture declaration + `seed doctor` — os-3c72f93f — plan PR #95
  (merged, amended: exit 13 `posture_invalid` allocation per review),
  task PR #98 — **done** (merged; exit 66 `unreadable` for read
  failures + valid-postures wording per review; card closed)
- 2.5 admission drills (raw-git adversary; kill-and-replace) —
  os-028dda91 — plan PR #96 (merged, amended: fresh-clone
  kill-and-replace per review), task PR #99 — review

## Phase 3 — Identity and grants (docs/next-build-plan.md Phase 3; deps: 2)

- 3.1 actor events + keyring projection — os-52a2d688 — plan PR #97
  (merged, amended: root-liveness guard + seed/1 activation boundary
  per review); implementation staged
- 3.2 admission checks grants per verb — os-3979d48b — backlog
- 3.3 key rotation/revocation drill — os-d1f35a8c — backlog

**Phase 2 exit (charter III.B subset): met.** The validator is the
guarded ref's sole writer under enforced posture (#94: invalid-stream,
rewrite, truncation, force-update, and deletion refusals, tree shape
included); statelessness is drilled by kill-and-replace (#99: a fresh
host rebuilt from a bare clone makes identical decisions and the chain
verifies from genesis); the posture declaration prints the cooperative
consequence verbatim (#98); the raw-git adversary drill runs per posture
with the cooperative consequence made observable (#99); both postures
are selectable in fixtures through the shared declaration (#99).
Capability rules slot in at Phase 3, fences at Phase 5, reservations at
Phase 7, as added rules on the shared set.

## Frontier

Phase 0, Phase 1, and 2.1 through 2.4 are done and closed. 2.5 (task PR
#99) is in review against its merged plan and carries the Phase 2 exit
record above. 3.1's plan (#97) is merged with its implementation
staged — its task PR ships next; 3.2 and 3.3 cards are filed behind it.
**Next action: as #99 merges, close os-028dda91 — Phase 2 then
completes; ship 3.1's task PR (keyring projection, seed/1 boundary),
then plan 3.2 (grants per verb). Phase 2 exit needs
the III.B subset: sole-writer enforced posture, statelessness
(kill-and-replace), posture declaration with the cooperative consequence
printed verbatim, and the direct-push refusal drill — all cited above.**
If an open task PR is red or carries review feedback, drive it green
first — nothing merges out of order.
