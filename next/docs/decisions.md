# decisions.md — Seed implementation decision log

One line per build-plan default exercised or overridden, linking the PR that
did it (docs/next-build-plan.md Phase 0 item 3). Decisions that needed more
than a line get an ADR under the repository's `decisions/` and a pointer
here. Newest last.

- 2026-08-30 — Phase 0 filed as **one card** (os-116ca9ac): items 1–3 are one
  coherent cluster sharing one exit criterion; later phases file one card per
  separable item. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — Module path `github.com/shaunlmason/open-seed/next`, pinned
  `go 1.25.0` for engine-toolchain parity (build-plan §0 "matches the
  existing engine"); no dependencies. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — Exit codes: v1-inherited table (0/2/3/4/5/6/10/64) adopted
  verbatim; new-code allocation rule documented in `next/spec/envelope.md`
  (fixed default: reuse v1 conventions where semantics match). (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — Envelope schema identifier `seed-envelope/0`; spec split:
  `protocol.md` (canonical form, events, verbs) + `envelope.md` (envelope,
  exit codes), satisfying both Phase 0 item 2 and the fixed-defaults table
  row naming `next/spec/envelope.md`. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — Genesis `prev` = SHA-256 of zero bytes (`e3b0c442…`); actor
  fingerprint = lowercase hex SHA-256 of the raw 32-byte Ed25519 public key;
  OpenSSH ed25519 keys accepted at key load only. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — Wire encodings fixed for `seed/0` (review finding on #71):
  everything is lowercase hex (chain hash 64 chars, signature 128 chars,
  fingerprint 64 chars); the ledger record is the wrapper
  `{"event": …, "sig": …}` with canonicalization applying to the inner
  event only; OpenSSH `SHA256:<base64>` display form excluded from the
  wire. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — Coverage gate (≥90% on `next/internal/...`) enforced from
  Phase 0, not Phase 1: enabling it early is strictly harder, never weaker;
  implemented via `-coverpkg=./internal/...` so CLI-level tests count toward
  internal coverage. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — Go comments in `next/**` follow the engine's no-em-dash rule
  (spin-out parity: the code migrates to the engine's conventions);
  markdown under `next/` keeps the template repo's prose style. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — `flavors/core-Makefile` refreshed alongside the `Makefile`
  edit: the validator enforces byte-identity (its refusal names the fix), so
  the mirror is a mechanical fan-out of the named integration point, not a
  second v1 surface. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — Version semantics refined (review finding on #75): every
  event carries the version *active at its position*; `system.protocol.upgraded`
  is the last event of the old version; verification is against a declared
  supported-versions set, so valid older prefixes replay after upgrades;
  exit 10 covers discipline violations and unsupported versions only. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — `check-next` output made byte-stable (CI finding on #72):
  tool output is captured and shown only on failure, because the
  flavor-test core-gate-independence check diffs `make check` output across
  runs and go's test timings and toolchain-download notices vary. (PR #72)
- 2026-08-30 — OpenSSH key fixtures are generated at test runtime
  (deterministic seed, `t.TempDir()`), never committed: forge push
  protection refuses private-key-shaped bytes even when synthetic, and the
  loaders only care about the wire format, which `ssh.MarshalPrivateKey`
  produces. Standing rule for every later fixture (verifier keyrings,
  sealed-check keys). (PR for os-aa146827)
- 2026-08-30 — Strict wire parsing (review findings on #76): records refuse
  unknown fields, duplicate keys at any level, and trailing data; hex
  encodings refuse uppercase rather than normalizing. Spec amended in the
  same PR (a normative addition beyond the plan's file scope, made under
  the review-fix allowance and noted here). (PR #76)
- 2026-08-30 — First module dependencies for 1.1: `github.com/gowebpki/jcs`
  v1.0.1 (RFC 8785 canonicalization; writing correct JCS by hand is
  subtle-risk with no upside) and `golang.org/x/crypto` (OpenSSH ed25519 key
  parsing); both boring, both pinned by go.sum. Ed25519/SHA-256 themselves
  stay stdlib. (PR for os-aa146827)
- 2026-08-30 — v1-loop delegation for `next:` cards: operator queue verbs
  (`promote`; `plan-unblock` once the gate PR is genuinely merged) run under
  the session principal (`shaunlmason`), work verbs under
  `seed-next-implementer`; implementation may be prepared ahead of the plan
  merge as a draft PR when the owner is merging in batches (CI's
  plan-at-merge-base gate still orders the merges). ADR:
  `decisions/0003-next-loop-delegation.md`. (PR #72)
