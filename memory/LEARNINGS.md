# Learnings

Append-only, via task PRs (D5). One dated bullet per durable insight about
*this codebase* — build quirks, API gotchas, decisions that keep resurfacing.
Fresh sessions read this file instead of rediscovering.

- 2026-08-22 (os-94ac6371): database/sql's `Begin` issues a *deferred*
  BEGIN — the fastcards store forces the write lock up front with a no-op
  `UPDATE meta` so the whole verb serializes (the plan's BEGIN IMMEDIATE
  semantics); rely on `busy_timeout` + a bounded jittered retry around it,
  never on raw SQLITE_BUSY reaching the caller.
- 2026-08-22 (os-94ac6371): `Mutation.Events` appends onto the run log read
  at the *pre-mutation* head — a migration that imports a run log must fold
  its own event into the imported content instead, or the append clobbers
  the migrated history (caught in the export/import round-trip test).
- 2026-08-22 (os-69bd5a64): a fake substrate must apply a mutation
  atomically — validate the whole input before writing any of it. The
  first refused-assign fixture applied `stateId` then errored on
  `assigneeId`, leaving a partial write no real GraphQL mutation could
  produce, and the adapter's (correct) compensation looked broken.
- 2026-08-22 (os-69bd5a64): when a port spec splits I/O declarations
  (`verbs.json`) from the wire schema (`envelope.schema.json`), fields
  land in one and not the other silently — the shim drops what the
  schema omits, so verb outputs existed on paper while callers never
  saw them. Cross-check the pair whenever either grows a field.
- 2026-08-22 (os-23494e11): `git fetch <url> <ref>` with no destination
  refspec stores no local ref — resolve what arrived through
  `FETCH_HEAD^{commit}` (which also peels annotated tags); pairing the
  fetch with `--no-write-fetch-head` leaves the objects unnameable.
- 2026-08-22 (os-23494e11): a lockfile can never record the SHA of the
  commit that contains it (writing the SHA changes the tree, which
  changes the SHA). Record the tag at release time and let the consumer
  stamp the resolved commit after the fact — provenance splits into
  "what the release declares" and "what the consumer verified".
- 2026-08-22 (os-52b9aed0): a gate is only trustworthy if it runs
  BEFORE the action it guards, and mock mode is only trustworthy if it
  stubs side-effecting `run:` steps too — "zero credentials" without
  "zero side effects" lets a mock run of a landing workflow reach a
  real merge.
- 2026-08-22 (os-52b9aed0): a review loop needs a remediation step
  wired into the gate itself; re-invoking a read-only reviewer on an
  unchanged implementation converges on nothing and burns
  max_revisions.
