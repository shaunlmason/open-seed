# Learnings

Append-only, via task PRs (D5). One dated bullet per durable insight about
*this codebase* — build quirks, API gotchas, decisions that keep resurfacing.
Fresh sessions read this file instead of rediscovering.

- 2026-08-22 (os-94ac6371): database/sql's `Begin` issues a *deferred*
  BEGIN — the fastcards store forces the write lock up front with a no-op
  `UPDATE meta` so the whole verb serializes (the plan's BEGIN IMMEDIATE
  semantics); rely on `busy_timeout` + a bounded jittered retry around it,
  never on raw SQLITE_BUSY reaching the caller.
- 2026-08-22 (os-94ac6371): `Mutation.Events` appends onto the run log read
  at the *pre-mutation* head — a migration that imports a run log must fold
  its own event into the imported content instead, or the append clobbers
  the migrated history (caught in the export/import round-trip test).
- 2026-08-22 (os-23494e11): `git fetch <url> <ref>` with no destination
  refspec stores no local ref — resolve what arrived through
  `FETCH_HEAD^{commit}` (which also peels annotated tags); pairing the
  fetch with `--no-write-fetch-head` leaves the objects unnameable.
- 2026-08-22 (os-23494e11): a lockfile can never record the SHA of the
  commit that contains it (writing the SHA changes the tree, which
  changes the SHA). Record the tag at release time and let the consumer
  stamp the resolved commit after the fact — provenance splits into
  "what the release declares" and "what the consumer verified".
