# Learnings

Append-only, via task PRs (D5). One dated bullet per durable insight about
*this codebase* — build quirks, API gotchas, decisions that keep resurfacing.
Fresh sessions read this file instead of rediscovering.

- 2026-08-22 (os-94ac6371): database/sql's `Begin` issues a *deferred*
  BEGIN — the fastcards store forces the write lock up front with a no-op
  `UPDATE meta` so the whole verb serializes (the plan's BEGIN IMMEDIATE
  semantics); rely on `busy_timeout` + a bounded jittered retry around it,
  never on raw SQLITE_BUSY reaching the caller.
- 2026-08-22 (os-94ac6371): `Mutation.Events` appends onto the run log read
  at the *pre-mutation* head — a migration that imports a run log must fold
  its own event into the imported content instead, or the append clobbers
  the migrated history (caught in the export/import round-trip test).
- 2026-08-22 (os-69bd5a64): a fake substrate must apply a mutation
  atomically — validate the whole input before writing any of it. The
  first refused-assign fixture applied `stateId` then errored on
  `assigneeId`, leaving a partial write no real GraphQL mutation could
  produce, and the adapter's (correct) compensation looked broken.
- 2026-08-22 (os-69bd5a64): when a port spec splits I/O declarations
  (`verbs.json`) from the wire schema (`envelope.schema.json`), fields
  land in one and not the other silently — the shim drops what the
  schema omits, so verb outputs existed on paper while callers never
  saw them. Cross-check the pair whenever either grows a field.
